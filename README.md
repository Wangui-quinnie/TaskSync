Introduction
TaskSync is a real-time task management application designed to help individuals and teams organize and track their tasks efficiently. Built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Socket.IO, TaskSync provides a seamless and collaborative task management experience with real-time updates and user authentication.

Inspiration
The inspiration for creating TaskSync came from the need to manage tasks dynamically and collaboratively. Many existing task management tools lack real-time updates, which are crucial for teams working in fast-paced environments. TaskSync addresses this gap by offering real-time synchronization of tasks, ensuring all team members are always on the same page.

Technical Challenge
The primary technical challenge I set out to solve was implementing real-time updates in a task management system. Ensuring that changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all other users required efficient use of WebSockets and a robust backend to handle concurrent connections and data consistency.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT.
CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Real-Time Updates: Instant updates using Socket.IO for real-time task management.
Responsive Design: User-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Real-Time Updates
TaskSync leverages Socket.IO to provide real-time updates. Any changes made to tasks by one user are instantly reflected for all connected users.

Technical Details
Backend
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. MongoDB is used as the database to store user and task information. Mongoose is used for schema definition and database operations.

Key Components
Authentication: JWT is used for secure authentication. Passport.js can be integrated for additional strategies.
Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO is used to manage real-time updates, ensuring that any change to tasks is instantly propagated to all users.

Frontend
The frontend is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application. AJAX or the Fetch API is used to communicate with the backend API endpoints.

Key Components
User Interface: A responsive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
Real-Time Updates: Integration with Socket.IO on the frontend to handle real-time task updates.
